Inside Social lets you require social actions: facebook likes or twitter follows, from site visitors to access specified site content.

== Description ==

Inside Social easily allows your WordPress site to prompt viewers to connect socially (Facebook likes, Twitter follows, Youtube subscribes etc.) to continue viewing content, using a ‘Social Gateway’. A Social Gateway can be an overlay or embedded within your content, and can be customized with any of your preferred social networks. You can choose what the gateways says, how it looks and when it shows up. With the Inside Social WordPress Plugin, displaying your social gateways on your content couldn’t be easier. Simply click the Inside Social button in the visual post editor, select your gateway, and update and save your post, and your loyal site readers will be shown a gateway when they access your content.
